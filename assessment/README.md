## 0. Practicals and Exercises

*Describe here the work that is in the ``practicals`` folder. Pay special attention
to any work you have included that is not taken from the sheets on MyBeckett. Write no more than 100 words.*
All practicals and Exercises have been made from the portfolio program questions. in 99 - the additional work folder is programs I used to get an idea of how it functions and works such as lambda or command line argument scripts etc. otherwise, they are solutions to the portfolio programs
## 1. Project

*Explain here which project you have completed in the ``project`` folder. Include a list of the features you have implemented. Write about 200 words. Remember that it is fine to have attempted both projects, in which case they should be arranged in separate folders.*

I have developed Project 2: Chatbot program for the University of Poppleton
## 2. Anything Else

*Is there anything else your marker needs to know? Please add it here.*

Unfortunately, there are some programs which I found difficult or had run out of time, very rarely some programs are are "Work in Progress" but you can see what I would include in the programs such as functions or parts of the program which could be involved
## 3. AI Tools

*Please indicate if you have used any AI tools, and if so, which ones, and how. If you have used none, just write "None".*
JetbrainsAI plugin, which is built-in on Pycharm (and can be used on the MyBeckett brief
AI has been used for research and debugging but very rarely (Which has been checked with the tutor, and small debugging is fine). No code has been changed by AI on my practicals or project work
