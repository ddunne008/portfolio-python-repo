This is a collection of my weekly programs

This contains answers to the questions in the portfolio programs

The only note I will mention is that some programs has been developed all by myself. Some programs have been helped with the use of the jetbrainsAI which is built-in (and can be used from the brief on MyBeckett)

Another note is that week 5 programs have been debugged by AI however I have checked with the tutor and has not be replaced whatsoever with ChatGPT or anything similar
I will note I have used AI for Research of programs which explains it easier but it has not been implemented the same way on the practicals and project

Enjoy my work if please there is any improvements I can make you can let me know via email or other communication if you want to otherwise, Thanks and enjoy.
