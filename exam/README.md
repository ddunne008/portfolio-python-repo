This folder will be used for the exam in January.

There is no need to do anything with it until then, but you should **not** remove it, or rename it. If you accidentally do change it, you can recreate it by creating a new folder called ``exam`` in the root folder of your repository.

All programs have been completed.

DD - The 4th Program is a Work In Progress but i added what I think could be involved to meet the requirements. But the programs all work and have been developed following the requirements with my justification!
