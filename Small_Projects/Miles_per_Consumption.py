# This Python program reads a list of data and then calculates the maximum Miles per gallon value and the average consumption of fuel

# This code file is a WIP. Unfortuntely could not program it to read the external file so I have added the contents as a list called 'data' instead
# I believe that for the file to be accessed it would possible involve Import sys and the sys.argv so it can read command line arguments.
